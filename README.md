# Git FLow

1. First of all we create a branch from master
2. Then we work on that branch and make changes
3. Then raise a PR, assign a reviewer to it
4. Reviewer reviews the PR and if all the standards are followed then PR is accepted else declined with comment
5. If accepted the simply merge into master branch
6. Before master branch in some projects we have development branch too
